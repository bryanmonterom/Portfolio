# Web system for the automation of the Processing Form Interdepartmental (FTI) for a Dominican University

## Project to obtain the degree of systems engineer (2020)



The FTI Digital web application aims to improve the way in which interdepartmental requests are processed in terms of time, resources and costs, since with the use of this the time invested in sending documents from department to department for signature of it, will be significantly reduced, and the resources that are invested to complete this task may be used in activities that generate more value for the institution. In the same way, the use of paper will be practically reduced to a minimum, since all processes will be completing web forms and attaching the documents digitally.
